## Description 

Hadith Quiz (Islamic Teachings)

### Problem Statement

Develop a web-based application that allows users to test their knowledge of authentic Hadiths through a quiz. The application will present users with a series of true or false questions. Users should be able to access the questions, progress through them, and have their scores updated accordingly. Upon completing the quiz, the application should provide users with their scores.

### Solution

The Hadith will be organized into a structured format, including whether it is true or false. The application will be designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the quiz layout. It will implement a ‘Next’ button to allow users to progress through the quiz and move to the next question. The program will also have categories that will allow users to choose which category they want to quiz on.

### MVP Features

- Display Hadith questions one at a time with true or false options.
- Keep track of users' scores as they answer the questions correctly.
- Allow users to retake the quiz.

### Technical Expectation

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- Score tracking as users progress to the next question.
- Handle user events such as button clicks to trigger actions such as checking answers.
- Implement JavaScript to generate the quiz interface with Hadith questions and options.
- Include categories to allow users to choose which category they want to quiz on.
